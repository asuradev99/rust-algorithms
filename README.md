# Rust Algorithms
This is a collection of algorithms I have implemented in Rust. 
## Current Project: Fast Fourier Transform for Polynomial Multiplication
### TODO
- Allow FFT-poly to run with input sizes that are not powers of 2
- Benchmark FFT for all input sizes from 2 to 2^16 
- General cleanup
- Use BigInt instead of standard vectors? 

## List of Algorithms Completed:
### Sorting
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort

### Multiplication 
- Standard Multiplication Algorithm (Long Multiplication)
- Cooley-Tukey Algorithm 

### Other 
- Fast Fourier Transform 


## List of WIP/Todo Algorithms: 
- Sorting (Shell sort, Heap Sort, Quick Sort, Counting Sort,m )
- Graph Algorithms (Kruskal's algorithm, Tree traversals, Topo Sort Algorithm)
- Pathfinding Algorithms (A*, Breadth/Depth First Search, Dijkstra, Distance-vector, Lee's Algorithm, etc.)
- Number Theory Algorithms (GCD-finding Algorithms, Integer factorization, Karatsuba's multiplication algorithm, primality test algorithms)
