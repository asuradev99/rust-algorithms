# Rust Algorithms
This is a collection of algorithms I have implemented in Rust. 
## Current Project: Fast Fourier Transform for Polynomial Multiplication
### TODO
- Allow FFT-poly to run with input sizes that are not powers of 2
- Benchmark FFT for all input sizes from 2 to 2^16 
- General cleanup

## List of Algorithms Completed:
### Sorting
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort

### Other 
- Fast Fourier Transform
- Standard Multiplication Algorithm (Long Multiplication)

## List of WIP/Todo Algorithms: 
- Quick Sort
- Shell Sort
- Pathfinding Algorithms (A*, Breadth/Depth First Search, Dijkstra, Distance-vector, etc.)
