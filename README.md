# Rust Algorithms
This is a collection of algorithms I have implemented in Rust. 
## Current Project: Fast Fourier Transform for Polynomial Multiplication
Todo: 
- Use BigNum or another crate such as Ramp to handle bigger numbers more idiomatically
- Refactor FFT code to remove duplicate ifft subroutine
- Refactor the FFT poly driver code
- Refactor the standard multiplication algorithm code
- Compare the running times of the FFT poly driver and the standard algo (Criterion, gnuplot, bench)


## List of Algorithms Completed:
### Sorting
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort

## List of WIP Algorithms: 
- Fast Fourier Transform
- Standard Multiplication Algorithm (Long Multiplication)
